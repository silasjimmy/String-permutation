# String permutation

A function to generate a list of string permutations using recursion. itertools has a permutation function so there is no need of writing one from scratch. This was solely for practice on using recursion. The challenge is to write a function, with less lines of code than mine, to generate permutations given a string of length n>=0 and the rules being:

1. Must return a list of the permutations.
2. Must use recursion.
